Three specific things really annoy her about Jerry, and she’s ready to tell him. But the location? Well, it’s not exactly ideal for a breakup. Write a scene that describes an unusual or hilarious location for a breakup, and let Simone tell Jerry exactly what it is about him that is causing this breakup.  |
| 4/8 | INT – Subway Station – Night | Felipe; Joan | Felipe and Joan bolt down the stairs into a seedy subway station. Lights flicker, and it’s dead empty. | Write a scene showing Felipe and Joan in the subway station as they try to escape from something or someone. But that thing finds them! The audience can’t see what is chasing them, only the characters’ reactions to it. |
